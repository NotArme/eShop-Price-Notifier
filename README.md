This project was made mainly as a way to learn the Qt api

All data is gathered from https://eshop-prices.com/

All prices are in BRL, I may add conversion to other currencies if requested

An windows executable can be found on Releases, otherwise, it can be created by running `python setup.py build` on this directory
